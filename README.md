# FXRHueChanger
A simple Mass SFX recoloring/hue changing tool meant to be used with WitchyBND's FXR XML formatter. Can be used to create new variations of effects like shown. (Inspired by Amir's DS3 tool that did the same thing way back)

INSTRUCTIONS:
• Unpack your .fxr files using WitchyBND, which will result in .xml files
• Place your .xml files in the same directory as the tool
• Simply set the color hue value (you can reference from the wheel image) in the config.ini file, then run the ER-Recolor.exe
• Re-convert the .xml file to .fxr using WitchyBND and place in the game

NOTE: Ensure that if you change the ID of the fxr, that you change the <Id> in the xml file before converting back to fxr; as it will cause problems of it appearing and disappearing. Also don't forget to create a reslist for it, it can be empty it's fine.
